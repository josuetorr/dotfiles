# Architecture
we need two websites, one for the staff and one for our clients. We might need to develop for other devices eventually, therefore we will have a central api where other clients may interact with the db.

* api: using golang with chi
* admin: svelte vs angular
* client website: svelte vs angular
* mobile: flutter
* auth: not sure yet, need to research
	* maybe we should have an auth server
	* use 3rd party service: clerk, workos, etc
