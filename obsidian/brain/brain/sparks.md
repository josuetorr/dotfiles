It is sometimes difficult for me to simply stop. There's a fear lingering when I think of stopping. As if it's teasing me to come but knows I won't. I avoid it instead of facing it. Using by shutting my brain and indulging in that toxic sludge that has consumed the internet. It makes me feel worse. I'm beginning to see it as the physical manifestation of what's on my mind. I criticize it. I shame it. I despise it. Yet, I keep coming back. Without noticing, I became what I loathed. How humorous is life. Without any one telling me, I realized I'm all talk. The realization has, oddly enough, giving me strength. I'm trying to rewire my brain, with these sparks. It feels like each thought has a will of its own. Trying to guide me to where I should go. There are some bad ones, you just have to know which to follow. As I read what I wrote, I realized I was getting further and further away from the original sparks. Guess that's how this brain works. But when I do stop and I sit with the fear. It becomes shy and quite. It tells me what it thinks, what it wants, what it's afraid of. It sometimes becomes aggressive and hateful. Reminds me of me as a child. The child that needed emotional support. Let's take a break, this was hella fun my dude. Writing my thoughts seems to helps a lot. Gotta stop trying not to stop :)
