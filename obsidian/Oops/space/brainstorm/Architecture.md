# Peer
A peer is the sovereign owner of the node. They own the data. A peer can publish any data they desire with their own permissions. These permission prohibit either another peer, another peer's assistant or any third-party service to access said chunk of data. 

A peer may follow another peer. Depending on what and how they decide to follow, some data may be pushed to them on demand or on a schedule basis.
