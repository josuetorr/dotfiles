# Premise
The idea of space is to have your own space in this universe. A space that will be forever yours no matter where and when you are. Bring your own world anywhere. 

# Concept
Have your own node in space that can be installed on any host machine.  You can share any data to whomever you wish, however you wish.  Hopefully there will be a way to monetize your instances. Use of generative artificial intelligence to generate user prompted homepages. Ability to know what your friends are up to and share what you are up to. You can form groups of instances on topics. Maybe as a topic grows, we can use that to leverage income trough anonymous data selling.
